The project is just a simple login page for any website which takes input from the user and their information and accepts poetries as an input 
I have made this using PHP and myadminphp database which requires xampp controller to run and connect to the database and sql server .
My laptop was not supporting the given API and django rest framework . However I chose not to give up and still do the task .
I know I have not done the task as intended but I can show u on my Laptop in the interview .
I hope that i get into the interview round .
And at last a Thank You for giving me an opportunity to be a part of this thrilling challenge given by you it was sure tricky and seemed tough but I tried my best.
THANK YOU:)
